proj|tags|speed|angle|xyPos|xyVel|size|startPos|duration
-tags		
 +circle	    standard circle projectile
 +laser		    laser (cannot have both laser and circle)
 +wallBounce	bounce off walls, requires duration
 +screenWrap	wraps screen edges
-angle		    angle of projectile movement (degrees)(counterclockwise from right)
-speed 		    speed of projectile (pixels/frame)
-xyPos		    position of projectile (overrides angle and speed)
-xyVel		    velocity of projectile (overrides xyPos, angle, and speed)
-size		    radius of projectile (or half of width of laser)
-startPos	    pos to spawn projectiles (x,y)
-duration	    # times it will wallBounce(or similar), or # frames a proj will exist, -1 is infinity
-actDelay	    # frames before the projectile can collide with the player

boss|#1|#2|#3|#4	moves the boss sprite to #1,#2 at #3 pixels/frame and rotates at #4 degrees/frame

repeat|#1|#2	    repeats from line #1, #2 - 1 times

ifGoto|#1|#2        if #1 is equal to 1, go to line #2

val#1|#2    	    sets val#1 to #2 (stored for later usage)

wait|#1		        waits #1 of frames before spawning projectiles again (including this frame)

:name               creates a label "name" that indicates the line it is on

visual              indicates a visual map (one that is not meant to be played) (player cannot lose)


Available Values:
t		    the age of the projectile (or game)

LXPOS		position from last frame
LYPOS

LYVEL		
LSPD		the speed from the last frame
LANG		the angle from the last frame


Available Functions:
ABS #1		returns the absolute value of #1
FLR #1		the integer part of #1
MOD #1 #2	returns the modulus of #1 / #2
RNG #1 #2	picks a random number between #1 (inclusive) and #2 (exclusive)
SIGN #1		sign of #1
SQRT #1		square root of #1
MAX #1 #2	the higher of the two values
MIN #1 #2	the lower of the two values

SIN #1		sine of #1
COS #1		cosine of #1
TAN #1		tangent of #1
ASIN #1		inverse sine of #1
