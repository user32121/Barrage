proj|tags=circle|speed=1|angle=10|etc        fires a projectile with the given properties
-tags
 +circle        standard circle projectile
 +laser         laser (cannot have both laser and circle)
 +wallBounce    bounce off walls, requires duration
 +screenWrap    wraps screen edges
 +outside       projectile won't despawn when it goes offscreen
-angle          angle of projectile movement (degrees)(counterclockwise from right)
-speed          speed of projectile (pixels/frame)
-xPos           x position of projectile (overrides angle and speed)
-yPos           y position of projectile (overrides angle and speed)
-xVel           x velocity of projectile (overrides xPos, yPos, angle, and speed)
-yVel           y velocity of projectile (overrides xPos, yPos, angle, and speed)
-size           radius of projectile (or half of width of laser)
-startX         x position to fire projectile from
-startY         y position to fire projectile from
-duration       # frames a proj will exist, -1 is infinity
-tagCount       # times a proj will wallBounce (or similar), -1 is infinity
-actDelay       # frames before the projectile can collide with the player, -1 is infinity
-file           a number indicating which image file to use (e.g. 0 will get Projectile0.png)
-state          an arbitrary number to allow for more complex projectile behavior

wait|#1             waits #1 of frames before spawning projectiles again (including this frame)

gotoIf|#1|#2        go to line #1 if #2 is not 0

repeat|#1|#2        repeats from line #1, #2 - 1 times

boss|#1|#2|#3|#4    moves the boss sprite to #1,#2 at #3 pixels/frame and rotates at #4 degrees/frame

val|#1|#2            sets val#1 to #2 (stored for later usage)

:name               creates a label "name" that indicates the line it is on

rng|#1              sets the random number generator seed to #1

visual              indicates a visual map (one that is not meant to be played and the player cannot lose)

freeze|#1           freezes the player for #1 frames
