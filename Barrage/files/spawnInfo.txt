proj|tags|speed|angle|xyPos|xyVel|size|startPos|duration        fires a projectile with the given properties
-tags		
 +circle	    standard circle projectile
 +laser		    laser (cannot have both laser and circle)
 +wallBounce	bounce off walls, requires duration
 +screenWrap	wraps screen edges
 +outside   	projectile won't despawn when it goes offscreen
-angle		    angle of projectile movement (degrees)(counterclockwise from right)
-speed 		    speed of projectile (pixels/frame)
-xyPos		    position of projectile (overrides angle and speed)
-xyVel		    velocity of projectile (overrides xyPos, angle, and speed)
-size		    radius of projectile (or half of width of laser)
-startPos	    pos to fires projectile (x,y) from
-duration	    # frames a proj will exist, -1 is infinity
-tagCount       # times a proj will wallBounce (or similar), -1 is infinity
-actDelay	    # frames before the projectile can collide with the player, -1 is infinity
-file   	    a number indicating which image file to use (e.g. 0 will get Projectile0.png)

wait|#1		        waits #1 of frames before spawning projectiles again (including this frame)

ifGoto|#1|#2        if #1 is equal to 1, go to line #2

repeat|#1|#2	    repeats from line #1, #2 - 1 times

boss|#1|#2|#3|#4	moves the boss sprite to #1,#2 at #3 pixels/frame and rotates at #4 degrees/frame

val#1|#2    	    sets val#1 to #2 (stored for later usage)

:name               creates a label "name" that indicates the line it is on

rng|#1              sets the random number generator seed to #1

visual              indicates a visual map (one that is not meant to be played) (player cannot lose)
