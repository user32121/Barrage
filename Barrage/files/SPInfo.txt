-tags		
 +circle	standard circle projectile
 +laser		laser (cannot have both laser and circle)
 +wallBounce	bounce off walls, requires duration
 +screenWrap	wraps screen edges
-angle		angle of projectile movement (degrees)(counterclockwise from right)
-speed 		speed of projectile (pixels/frame)
-xyPos		position of projectile (overrides angle and speed)
-xyVel		velocity of projectile (overrides xyPos, angle, and speed)
-size		radius of projectile (or half of width of laser)
-startPos	pos to spawn projectiles (x,y)
-duration	# times it will wallBounce(or similar), or # frames a laser will exist

repeat|#1|#2	repeats from line #1 #2 times

val#1|#2	sets val#1 to #2 (stored for later usage)

wait|#1		waits #1 of frames before spawning projectiles again (including this frame)
